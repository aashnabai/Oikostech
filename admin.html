  <h2>Admin / Submissions</h2>
  <p>This page is intentionally minimal. For privacy and security, complaints and booking submissions are not shown here. Use your Netlify dashboard (Forms) or Formspree account to view private submissions.</p>
  <p>If you'd like an admin area on the site, we'll need to implement Netlify Identity + Functions or a small backend. Ask me and I can add instructions and code for that.</p>
